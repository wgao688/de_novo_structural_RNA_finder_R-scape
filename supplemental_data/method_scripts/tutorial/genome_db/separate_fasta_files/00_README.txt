# This directory contains the sequences corresponding to species belonging to the Saccharomyces genome. 

# The size of these files is too large to store as a single FASTA file. To deal with this constraint, please download this directory and then use:

cat *.fa > Saccharomyces_genomes.fa to create the file for use in the tutorial.
