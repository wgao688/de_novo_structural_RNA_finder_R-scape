# Discovery of 17 conserved structural RNAs in fungi: A de novo structural RNA gene finder

This github respository contains the supplemental code for Gao et al. 2021: Discovery of 17 conserved structural RNAs in fungi. Nucleic Acids Research. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8216456/). This paper describes a method for de novo structural RNA gene finder. Our method is based on the computational method R-scape (Rivas et al. 2017: A statistical test for conserved RNA structure shows lack of evidence for structure in lncRNAs (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27819659/). R-scape accepts as input a multiple sequence alignment of homologous sequences across different species. By performing pairwise comparison of the covariation of residues in the alignment while taking into account the phylogeny of the sequences in the alignment, R-scape identifies residues that covary beyond phylogenetic expectation. These residues provide evolutionary support for conserved RNA secondary structure. The initial 2017 R-scape paper assesses the evolutionary support for conserved structure of known RNAs, identifying lack of evidence for conserved structure for some long non-coding RNAs. The 2021 paper extends this framework by examining the ability of R-scape to identify structural support for novel ncRNAs. 

Our method uses the evidence signature of compensatory base pairs to detect evidence of conservation of RNA structure. Structural RNAs, including large families such as ribosomal RNAs and transfer RNAs, are RNAs that exert their function using a conserved structure involving secondary structure interactions (Watson-Crick and wobble base pairing) as well as other structural interaction such as pseudoknots. Standalone structural RNAs include the rRNA and tRNA families among others and are transcribed as individual entities. In contrast, cis-regulatory structures, often located in the 5' and 3' untranslated regions of messenger RNA, are transcribed as only part of the full length transcript. To deal with these two possibilities separately, we devise an iterative homology search method that takes in a single query reference from a genome of choice (e.g., reference organism such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Using nhmmer, we build a multiple sequence alignment of homologous sequences. We then run R-scape to assess for evidence of conserved structure. Refining our method in positive control known structured RNAs, we identified 17 conserved structural RNAs in fungi.
