This github respository contains the supplemental code for Gao et al. 2021: Discovery of 17 conserved structural RNAs in fungi. Nucleic Acids Research. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8216456/). This paper describes a method for de novo structural RNA gene finder. It was the computational method R-scape (Rivas et al. 2017: A statistical test for conserved RNA structure shows lack of evidence for structure in lncRNAs
(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27819659/).

Our method uses the evidence signature of compensatory base pairs to detect evidence of conservation of RNA structure. Structural RNAs, including large families such as ribosomal RNAs and transfer RNAs, are RNAs that exert their function using a conserved structure involving secondary structure interactions (Watson-Crick and wobble base pairing) as well as other structural interaction such as pseudoknots. Standalone structural RNAs include the rRNA and tRNA families among others and are transcribed as individual entities. In contrast, cis
